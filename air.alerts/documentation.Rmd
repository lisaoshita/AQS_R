# Description of how scripts function

The main function of send.alert.R that will be run is text.alert(). text.alert() takes the name of the file that contains pm10 values as a character string argument. After reading in the file, the function formats it and checks if the dates in the file are equal to the current date. If not, the function stops and returns the message, "Old file". If the dates are current, then the function sets all pm10 values that are greater than 800 to NA. It then checks if all pm10 values are less than 175. If true, the function stops and returns the message, "No text sent". If false, the function sets any pm10 values that are greater than 175 and that occurred before 8:00am, to NA. The function checks again if all values of pm10 are less than 175. If true, the function stops and returns, "No text sent". If false, the function reads in the log of text messages sent, and if a text was already sent that day, the function stops and returns, "Text already sent today". If not, the function initializes an empty data frame that will be used later on to store message information. A
