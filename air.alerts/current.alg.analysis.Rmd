# Objective

This markdown characterizes the current algorithm

* How accurate? (when the alg predicts that a text should be sent out - how accurate is it?)
* When, on average, is a text message triggered
* How often does it not work b/c data is missing.
* Seasonal pattern to wrong predictions?

```{r}
# load data
cdf <- read_csv("H:/TECH/Lisa/R/apcd.r/air.alerts/cdf.csv", 
                skip = 3, 
                col_names = c("Date", "WSV", "WDV", "ATM", "pm"))

# change date to date time
cdf <- cdf %>%
  mutate(Date = parse_date_time(Date, "d!-b!-Y! H!:M!"))

# arch.cdf <- read_csv("H:/TECH/Lisa/R/apcd.r/air.alerts/arch-cdf.csv",
#                      col_types = list(wsv = "n", wdv = "n", sigt = "n",
#                                       bam10 = "n", bam25 = "n", date = "c"))
